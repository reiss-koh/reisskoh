      title: 'ðŸŒŸ Why I Chose Research'
      subtitle: ''

        Out of the blue, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, I began suffering from chronic pain. It was excruciating pain, 24/7. I had to go to the emergency room twice and faced significant physio-psychological challenges. Despite consulting multiple clinical departments and major institutions, I was unable to receive a definitive diagnosis. 
        
        Naturally, I took matters into my own handsâ€”I read numerous research papers and other online resources to try to find a diagnosis, while continuing to search for clinicians who could help me. Eventually, through modern science, my chronic pain was (mostly) resolved after 1.5 years after numerous interventions.
        
        In addition, most of my pain-induced psychological challenges have been fully resolved, and I believe I am now arguably healthier than before. Through this journey, I came to realize that my well-beingâ€”and that of othersâ€”rests on the shoulders of science and technology. I believe I wouldnâ€™t be where I am today without the support of science and society, and I feel it is my responsibility to give back what I have received.
