## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! **&#91;WIP&#93;** My principal research interest is at the intersection of **Language Models** and **Agentic Behaviour**. I am currently working on efficient and effective LM reasoning training **&#91;P1&#93;**; but nevertheless interested in a wide range of open problems. My past works make **&#91;C1&#93;** multi-agents more generalizable and significantly more reliable; and **&#91;W1&#93;** improves agents in noisy environments. I have also made an **&#91;C2&#93;** agentic LLM-as-a-Judge framework for scalable LM-based (multi-modal) chart generation, with robust improvements across 27B, 70B, and frontier-level LMs. In the past, I worked on **&#91;J1&#93;** personalization and user-centric machine learning; and **&#91;W2&#93;** improving time-series representation learning under non-stationarity.

I am perfectly bilingual in **English** and **Korean**. I love to chat about research and downstream impact; feel free to reach out to me via email ðŸ“§.
